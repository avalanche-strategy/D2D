Interviewer: Alright, diving into food and memories—what dish instantly brings your childhood back?

Interviewee: Oh man, my mom’s arroz con leche. She’d make it every time I was sick, or honestly, just when I needed cheering up. The cinnamon smell still makes me emotional sometimes.

Interviewer: Can you describe a meal that holds special meaning for you?

Interviewee: Our Christmas Eve dinner. It’s this big spread—tamales, roasted pork, rice, beans. It’s loud and chaotic and full of stories. It’s more than food—it’s our whole culture on a table.

Interviewer: What about food and family traditions—how do they connect?

Interviewee: They’re basically the same thing in my family. Recipes are sacred. Like, if you try to tweak my aunt’s flan recipe, you might start a family feud. [laughs]

Interviewer: What’s the first thing you learned to cook?

Interviewee: French toast! I was like nine, and I made it for my dad on Father’s Day. I used way too much cinnamon, but he ate it like it was gourmet. I’ll never forget that.

Interviewer: What’s your go-to comfort food?

Interviewee: Pasta. Any kind. When I’m stressed, I make a big pot of spaghetti with whatever sauce I have. There’s something soothing about the process.

Interviewer: Any food tied to a place or person for you?

Interviewee: Yeah—empanadas always remind me of my grandma in Buenos Aires. She’d let me help fold the dough, and I’d sneak bits of the filling when she wasn’t looking.

Interviewer: What’s the most memorable meal you’ve shared?

Interviewee: My wedding dinner. We had a small backyard setup with homemade tacos and churros. Everyone said it was the best food they’d ever had, and it just felt *us*, you know?

Interviewer: Favorite dish from another culture?

Interviewee: Japanese ramen. The broth, the noodles, the toppings—it’s like a bowl of magic. I tried making it once. Total disaster. [laughs]

Interviewer: How has your view of food changed over time?

Interviewee: I used to see it as something you had to control, especially in sports. But now, I see it as something to enjoy and celebrate. It connects people in ways nothing else does.
