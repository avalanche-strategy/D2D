Interviewer: Alright, let’s dive in. I want to talk about a movie that’s really stuck with you—one that’s more than just entertaining. Something that’s actually meant something in your life. Got one?
Interviewee: Oh my gosh, yes. Without a doubt, it’s *Dead Poets Society*. I remember watching it for the first time in my final year of high school, and I was absolutely floored.

Interviewer: What pulled you in? Was it the story, the characters, something else?
Interviewee: I think it was the atmosphere more than anything at first. That old-school prep environment, the poetry, Robin Williams—it just felt like something deep was going on. And then when Mr. Keating says “Carpe diem,” that hit hard. I was like—wait, I’ve heard that before, but I never *felt* it until now.

Interviewer: Do you remember how it made you feel the first time you saw it?
Interviewee: Oh yeah. I was stunned. I actually sat in silence after the movie ended. Like, I couldn’t even speak. I was crying but not in a sobbing way—just quiet tears. It felt like the movie had reached into my soul and kind of… rearranged something.

Interviewer: That’s powerful. Is there a particular scene that’s stayed with you the most?
Interviewee: The end. When the boys stand on their desks and say “O Captain! My Captain!”—man, I still get goosebumps thinking about it. It’s such a quiet rebellion, but so strong. Like, this is them saying “We see you. We believe in what you taught us.” That stayed with me, big time.

Interviewer: Do you think it changed you in any way?
Interviewee: Absolutely. It made me want to live more deliberately, I guess. I stopped trying to just tick boxes—grades, clubs, achievements—and started asking myself what *I* actually cared about. It even pushed me to pursue English Lit instead of something more “practical,” as my parents would’ve said. [laughs]

Interviewer: Have you recommended the movie to anyone else?
Interviewee: Oh, so many people. It’s like my personal mission. Any time someone’s feeling lost or unsure about life, I’m like “You *have* to watch Dead Poets Society.” My partner and I rewatch it every year together now—it’s a tradition.

Interviewer: So it’s one of those movies you return to again and again.
Interviewee: Yup. Every time I rewatch it, I notice something new. And it always reminds me of why I chose the path I did. I think that’s rare in movies—like, for a film to grow with you like that.

Interviewer: Has it shifted your perspective on anything in particular—like love, identity, maybe even how you define success?
Interviewee: For sure. Especially around success. I used to think it meant high-paying jobs and big titles. But that movie… it made me realize that expressing yourself, connecting deeply with others, creating art—that *is* success. At least for me. It also made me a big believer in the power of good teachers. Like, one teacher can literally change your entire life.

Interviewer: That’s so true. If you had to sum up what this movie has meant to you in a single sentence, what would you say?
Interviewee: Hmm… I’d say: “It reminded me that life isn’t about following rules—it’s about writing your own verse.”

Interviewer: That’s beautiful. Do you still think about the movie in your day-to-day life?
Interviewee: All the time. Especially when I’m stuck in a routine or second-guessing myself. I think about Mr. Keating saying “make your lives extraordinary.” It’s become this voice in my head whenever I’m tempted to play it safe.

Interviewer: And do you think the film still resonates in today’s world?
Interviewee: Maybe even more than before. In a world that’s so structured and performance-driven, we need more reminders to be curious, to feel deeply, to question norms. And also to appreciate the arts and literature—not just as hobbies but as real sources of strength.

Interviewer: That’s incredibly thoughtful. If you could talk to Mr. Keating—like, the character—what would you say?
Interviewee: Oh wow… I think I’d just thank him. Thank him for seeing something in those boys that nobody else saw. And by extension, for helping me see something in myself too.

Interviewer: Thanks so much. This has been one of those conversations I’ll remember.
Interviewee: Same here. Thanks for letting me talk about it—it’s honestly such a joy to revisit that movie every chance I get.
