Interviewer: Let’s talk food. What’s a dish that reminds you of your childhood?

Interviewee: Definitely my grandma’s chicken and rice. She used to make it every Sunday, and the smell would just take over the whole house. It was simple—nothing fancy—but it was filled with love.

Interviewer: Can you describe a meal that has a special meaning for you?

Interviewee: Yeah, actually. My 18th birthday dinner. My parents surprised me by cooking all my favorite dishes—pad thai, roasted veggies, and this chocolate lava cake I was obsessed with. I remember feeling really seen, you know?

Interviewer: How do food and family traditions connect for you?

Interviewee: Food is like... the center of everything in my family. Every celebration, every holiday—we cook together. It’s kind of how we show love and keep traditions alive, especially recipes passed down from my great-grandmother.

Interviewer: What’s the first meal you remember learning to cook?

Interviewee: Scrambled eggs! [laughs] My dad taught me when I was seven. I remember feeling so proud, even though I burned them a little. It was the first time I felt like I had made something on my own.

Interviewer: Is there a food that always makes you feel comforted?

Interviewee: Tomato soup with grilled cheese. It’s my go-to on rainy days or when I’m feeling a little off. It’s like a hug in food form.

Interviewer: Do you associate any food with a specific place or person?

Interviewee: Oh, totally. Mango sticky rice reminds me of my trip to Thailand with my best friend. We had it every night from this street vendor who remembered our names. That connection made it so memorable.

Interviewer: What’s the most memorable meal you’ve ever shared with someone?

Interviewee: Hmm... I’d say the night my partner and I moved into our first apartment. We didn’t have furniture yet, just sat on the floor eating pizza straight out of the box. It felt like the start of something real.

Interviewer: Do you have a favorite food from another culture?

Interviewee: Ethiopian injera with lentils and greens. I love the flavor, the way you eat with your hands—it just feels communal and warm. Plus, the spices are amazing.

Interviewer: How has your relationship with food changed over time?

Interviewee: I used to stress a lot about eating “right” or counting everything. But now, I’ve learned to enjoy food, listen to my body, and appreciate the memories it holds. Food became less about rules and more about connection.
