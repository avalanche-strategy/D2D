Welcome! I’m excited to dive into this conversation. Let’s start with a quick intro: what’s your name, where do you live, and who’s at home with you?

Participant  0:08
Hey there, I’m Alicia. I live in Birmingham, Alabama. It’s just me, my partner, and our cat—though we have family nearby.

Interviewer  0:15
Great. So let’s jump in. How do you perceive crime in your community—rising, falling, or about the same?

Participant  0:21
I feel like it’s gone up, at least from what neighbors talk about online. But again, social media might inflate that. Either way, people are more cautious.

Interviewer  0:29
What types of crime concern you most?

Participant  0:31
Break-ins and robberies. I’m also aware that some violent incidents have been happening, but robberies feel more common near me.

Interviewer  0:37
I see. One area we’re interested in is how safe you *personally* feel. Would you say you feel generally safe?

Participant  0:44
I do, mostly because I know my neighbors and we look out for each other. But at night, I’m more careful than I used to be.

Interviewer  0:50
Got it. Thinking about solutions: are there any specific policies or programs you’d like to see expanded to reduce crime?

Participant  0:56
Yes—I’d love to see more local job training, especially for people coming out of prison. We talk a lot about “tough on crime,” but not so much about giving people real options when they return home.

Interviewer  1:06
That’s a recurring theme. What are your thoughts on how parole could be improved?

Participant  1:09
Parole rules can be very strict. It seems like a tiny slip-up can send someone back. I think we can keep people accountable without throwing them in prison at the first mistake.

Interviewer  1:17
And how about youth? Any particular concerns about under-18 incarceration?

Participant  1:21
I just don’t believe in sending kids to adult jails. It seems like a sure way to traumatize them. We should try counseling, mentorship, all kinds of preventative measures.

Interviewer  1:29
Understood. Let’s also talk restorative justice. Do you believe it can be effective, especially for violent crimes?

Participant  1:35
Honestly, I think it depends on the case. I’m open-minded, but if we’re talking about a serious assault, both parties have to be willing to go through the process. Still, I like the concept overall.

Interviewer  1:44
Fair point. As we near the end: is there anything you’ve learned or started thinking about differently today?

Participant  1:48
I guess I realized how complex it all is—economics, mental health, policing. It’s never just one factor.

Interviewer  1:54
Very true. Any final thoughts or feelings you’d like to share before we wrap?

Participant  1:58
No, I think that covers it. Thanks for the chance to talk about these issues in depth.

Interviewer  2:01
My pleasure, Alicia. We’ll follow up if anything else comes up. Thank you again.

Participant  2:04
You bet, talk soon.
