Hello, thanks for joining me for this interview. Let’s jump right in with introductions. Could you share your name, where you live now, and something you value about your life?

Participant  0:09
My name’s Trevor. I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I’d say something I value a lot is the sense of connectedness in my neighborhood—we try to watch out for each other.

I love that. So, from a safety standpoint, how safe would you say people around you feel?

Participant  0:23
I think some folks feel uneasy. There’s been news about carjackings, and that rattles people. I personally still feel relatively safe, but I definitely lock my car doors now more than I used to.

Interviewer  0:31
That makes sense. Let’s talk about crime trends. Do you think crime is on the rise where you live?

Participant  0:37
I do. Or at least it seems that way from the headlines. It could be that social media amplifies every incident, but perception sometimes becomes reality for the community.

Interviewer  0:45
What types of crimes worry you the most?

Participant  0:47
Violent assaults and shootings worry me. It seems like there’s no rhyme or reason sometimes—random acts of violence are scary.

Interviewer  0:53
Absolutely. Shifting gears, what about incarceration policies? Are we locking too many people up, not enough, or is it about right?

Participant  1:00
I think we lock up too many people. Especially non-violent offenders who might benefit more from rehabilitation or job training. A big chunk of our state budget goes to prisons, and I’m not sure it’s helping as much as we think.

Interviewer  1:10
What do you think about parole systems? Should they be reformed?

Participant  1:13
Definitely. Parole sometimes sets up unrealistic rules—like check-ins in the middle of work hours. People can’t keep a job that way. Then they break parole, go back to prison, and it’s a revolving door.

Interviewer  1:23
That’s a strong statement. Have you encountered any stories of people stuck in that cycle?

Participant  1:26
Yes, I know a friend of a friend who missed a parole meeting because of car trouble. Boom, they end up getting violated. It’s tough.

Interviewer  1:32
Wow. How about restorative justice—do you feel that approach can be effective?

Participant  1:37
It can. I’ve seen some pilot programs in other states. It’s definitely not for every case, but I think it helps certain offenders truly own up to what they did, and it can help victims heal too.

Interviewer  1:45
Good point. And regarding youth incarceration—any thoughts?

Participant  1:49
We should really think twice before sending kids to prison. If we invest more in youth programs, mental health support, maybe we can prevent crime altogether.

Interviewer  1:56
Before we wrap, anything new you’ve realized by discussing these topics?

Participant  1:59
Mostly that we need a multi-pronged approach. Police alone can’t fix underlying issues of poverty or mental health.

Interviewer  2:03
Thanks, Trevor. Appreciate your time and insights.

Participant  2:06
Thank you. Glad to share.
