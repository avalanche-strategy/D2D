Hi there, thanks for joining me today. I appreciate you taking time out of your afternoon to talk about your views on community safety and crime. Could you start with a quick introduction? What’s your name and where are you located?

Participant  0:10
Sure thing. My name’s Camila, and I’m living right outside of Jackson, Mississippi. I’ve been here all my life.

Interviewer  0:16
Great to meet you, Camila! Could you share a bit about who lives with you at home?

Participant  0:20
Absolutely. I live with my husband, our two dogs, and my mom actually moved in last year to be closer to family.

Interviewer  0:25
Sounds like a full house! What’s one or two things you value most these days?

Participant  0:30
I really value family and community. I also think it’s essential to have a safe environment—feeling comfortable walking around your neighborhood, for instance.

Interviewer  0:37
That’s a perfect segue. Let’s talk about how safe you feel in your own community. Would you say you feel very safe, somewhat safe, not very safe...?

Participant  0:45
I’d say somewhat safe. Honestly, in the last couple of years, there’s been more petty crime. I’m not personally worried about violent crime, but car break-ins and property crime have seemed to go up.

Interviewer  0:54
I see. Do you think that’s a sign of overall crime trends increasing?

Participant  1:00
It’s hard to say for sure, because sometimes it’s just more visible on social media. But I do think there’s been an uptick—maybe related to the economy. When people are struggling, desperation can lead to more theft or vandalism.

Interviewer  1:12
That’s a good point. So if you had to recommend a policy approach to reduce crime, what do you think should be happening locally?

Participant  1:19
Well, I believe in more mental health resources, job training, and definitely youth programs. Sometimes we focus too much on punishment without fixing underlying causes—like a lack of support or job opportunities.

Interviewer  1:29
Have you seen any positive developments on that front?

Participant  1:32
A few nonprofits are offering after-school programs, which is great. But at a city or state level, I haven’t seen enough funding for mental health or re-entry services. It feels like we just keep building more prisons.

Interviewer  1:42
Interesting. What’s your view on the idea of restorative justice—where offenders might meet with victims or do community service rather than automatically get locked up?

Participant  1:50
I think it can be a good approach for lower-level offenses, or at least cases where it makes sense. Of course, for violent crimes, it might be different. But some alternative to incarceration might help break the cycle—especially for younger folks.

Interviewer  2:00
And speaking of younger folks, how do you feel about youths who get placed in adult correctional facilities?

Participant  2:06
I’m not a fan. Kids are still developing. Sticking them in an adult prison can do more harm than good. I think we need more juvenile rehabilitation options.

Interviewer  2:14
Thanks for sharing. As we wrap up, what’s on your mind about all these topics?

Participant  2:17
I guess I’m thinking about how complicated it is. There’s no one solution, but I’d love to see more emphasis on community-led programs and less on just punitive measures.

Interviewer  2:25
Great insight. Thanks again for talking with me, Camila. We might circle back if I have any follow-ups.

Participant  2:29
Of course. Happy to chat.
