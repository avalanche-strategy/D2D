Our evaluation is inspired by the RAGAS framework, which provides five main metrics - faithfulness, relevance, precision, recall, and correctness (when golden answers are available) to evaluate the model performance comprehensively[1]. However, RAGAS has some limitations when applied to Dialogue2Data, which we aim to address using strategies proposed in Daedalus v4[2].

- **Limitation in assessing answer style**: Our partner expects consistent response styles for downstream analytics, but current metrics lack assessment of sentence completeness, length, and clarity. We will add a consistency metric to measure stylistic alignment.

- **Bias introduced by model preferences**: RAGAS relies on LLMs, whose preference for templated answers may introduce bias and affect scoring objectivity. We apply prompt engineering to reduce the bias.

- **Lack of feedback mechanism**: RAGAS provides scores without supporting information, reducing interpretability and making it harder for quick manual validation. We will introduce a feedback module that presents the supporting information behind scoring.

- **Limited golden samples**: Correctness evaluation requires golden answers, which are limited. We adopt stratified sampling to create a small but high-quality golden sample set that includes fewer than 25 examples but covers a broad range of topics and linguistic styles. 

: Summary of our evaluation framework based on RAGAS with enhancement of Daedalus v4

| Module                     | Description                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Metrics in RAGAS**      | Faithfulness, Relevance, Precision, Recall, Correctness (when golden answer available) |
| **Metric extended from Daedalus v4** | Consistency                              |
| **Prompt engineering**    | To reduce LLM bias                          |
| **Feedback mechanism**    | To generate explanation                     |
| **Stratified sampling** | To create a small but diverse golden sample set      |
