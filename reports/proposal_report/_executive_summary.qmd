Surveys are a vital tool for organizations to capture direct user feedback, understand user needs and priorities, 
measure satisfaction, and gauge public opinion. Analyzing survey results helps guide meaningful product and service improvements. 
Surveys are an invaluable set of tools that help organizations know how well they are performing and help shape where they need to go.

Our capstone partner, Fathom, provides client organizations with commercial survey analytics solutions to fulfil this business need.
The traditional surveys that their clients have used in the past can however be rigid and impersonal, often resulting in low engagement 
and limited insights. To address this, Fathom is enhancing its analytics platform to support open, conversational surveys that use 
natural language, adaptive flows, and personalized questions. This flexible approach improves response quality, completion rates, 
and the depth of insights gathered. Nonetheless, extracting structured insights from open-ended responses presents a significant 
challenge. Unstructured data must be processed and standardized to enable aggregation and analysis at scale. Our capstone project 
tackles that challenge by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Specifically, we propose building a model - 
potentially based on a transformer architecture or Large Language Model (LLM) - to analyze user interview transcripts against a set of 
guideline queries representing organizational subject interests.

The goal of our system is to capture nuanced semantic relationships, making it well-suited to match free-text responses with key 
organizational themes. Our system will transform diverse, unstructured survey responses into structured summaries that can integrate 
seamlessly into Fathom's existing analytics pipeline while acurately capturing the information collected during the interviews.

By enabling automated, scalable analysis of open surveys, this solution will expand the volume and variety of surveys that Fathom 
can process. Ultimately, it will help their clients uncover richer, faster insights, enhancing strategic decision-making and 
improving the overall user experience.
