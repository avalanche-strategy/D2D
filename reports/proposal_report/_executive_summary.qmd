Surveys help organizations gather user feedback, understand needs, measure satisfaction, and guide product or service improvements. Fathom, our capstone partner, offers commercial survey analytics solutions that support open, conversational interviews using natural language, adaptive flows, and personalized questions. This flexible format improves response quality but poses challenges in extracting structured insights from the unstructured interview transcripts data.

To address this, we propose a system leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP), potentially using a transformer architecture or large language model (LLM). The goal is to minimize the human effort required by accurately capturing semantic relationships and matching free-text responses to key organizational questions. This system will convert varied survey inputs into structured summaries that fit into Fathom's current analytics pipeline, enabling scalability, in-depth analysis and faster, more informed decision-making for their clients.
