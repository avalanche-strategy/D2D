### Outline workflow

@fig-workflow shows the proposed pipeline.

![Workflow Outline](img/D2D_Workflow.jpg){#fig-workflow}

1. Perform text pre-processing on the guidelines and the interview transcripts using `pre_process.py`.
2. Feed the cleaned files into the core `D2D.py` script to generate an appropriate answer to each guideline question from each interview.
3. Build final `results.csv` output. _Stretch goal: Create `additional_insights.csv` containing responses in the interview that are useful information but do not answer any specific guideline question._

We propose to deliver the solution as a Python-based CLI tool that our capstone partner can incorporate in their current process.


### Pseudocode of the core process

In @fig-workflow we presented the core `D2D.py` as a single block. At a high-level, we can envisage this script to be broken down as per the pseudocode below:

![D2D Pseudocode](img/D2D_Process_all.png){#fig-d2d}

1. Generate an $N \times M$ grid, with $N$ rows corresponding to the number of interviews we have and $M$ columns corresponding to the number of guideline questions.
2. Iterate through each guideline question and each interview (each cell in the $N \times M$ grid). In this step, we retrieve answers from the interview transcript that are relevant to the current guideline question. It is possible to have 0 or more relevant responses.
3. Use the set of top retrieved responses to generate an appropriate answer to be populated for the current cell.
4. Repeat this process for all the cells.
