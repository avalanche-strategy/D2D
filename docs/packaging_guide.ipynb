    "# Packaging Guide for D2D Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a detailed guide on the structure of the `setup.py` file for the \"d2d\" package, how to generate a `.whl` file, and how to install the package in a clean environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the `setup.py` Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The `setup.py` file is the configuration script for packaging a Python project using `setuptools`. It defines metadata, dependencies, and package structure for the \"d2d\" (Dialogue2Data) project, which transforms interview transcripts into structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of `setup.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imports**:\n",
    "  - `from setuptools import setup, find_packages`: Imports the `setup` function to configure the package and `find_packages` to automatically discover all packages in the specified directory.\n",
    "  - The `open` function reads the `README.md` file for the long description.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reading the README**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  with open(\"README.md\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as fh:\n",
    "      long_description = fh.read()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - Opens the `README.md` file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding to include its content as the package's long description.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setup Function**:\n",
    "  The `setup()` function from `setuptools` defines the package metadata and configuration:\n",
    "  - `name=\"d2d\"`: The package name, used for distribution and installation (e.g., via `pip install d2d`).\n",
    "  - `version=\"0.2.8\"`: The current version of the package, following semantic versioning (major.minor.patch).\n",
    "  - `author=\"Sienko Ikhabi, Dominic Lam, Yun Zhou, Wangkai Zhu\"`: Lists the authors of the project.\n",
    "  - `author_email=\"your.email@example.com\"`: A contact email for the maintainers (should be updated to a valid email).\n",
    "  - `description=\"Dialogue2Data: Transform interview transcripts into structured data\"`: A short summary of the package's purpose.\n",
    "  - `long_description=long_description`: Uses the content of `README.md` for a detailed description.\n",
    "  - `long_description_content_type=\"text/markdown\"`: Specifies the format of the long description as Markdown.\n",
    "  - `url=\"https://github.com/avalanche-strategy/D2D\"`: The URL to the project’s repository (update to the actual repo URL).\n",
    "  - `package_dir={\"\": \"src\"}`: Maps the root package directory to the `src` folder, meaning all packages are searched for under `src/`.\n",
    "  - `packages=find_packages(where=\"src\")`: Automatically finds all packages (e.g., subdirectories with `__init__.py`) in the `src` directory.\n",
    "  - `include_package_data=True`: Ensures non-Python files (e.g., data files, if specified in `MANIFEST.in`) are included in the package.\n",
    "  - `install_requires=[...]`: Lists dependencies required for the package to function:\n",
    "    - `torch>=1.10.0`: For tensor operations with sentence transformers.\n",
    "    - `sentence-transformers>=2.2.0`: For embedding models.\n",
    "    - `litellm>=1.0.0`: For LLM interactions.\n",
    "    - `python-dotenv>=0.21.0`: For environment variable management.\n",
    "    - `pandas>=1.5.0`: For data manipulation.\n",
    "    - `numpy>=1.23.0`: For numerical operations.\n",
    "    - `tqdm>=4.65.0`: For progress bars.\n",
    "    - `openai>=1.0.0`: For OpenAI API client.\n",
    "    - `ragas>=0.1.0`: For evaluation (e.g., `run_ragas_evaluation`).\n",
    "    - `rapidfuzz>=3.9.0`: For fuzzy string matching.\n",
    "  - `classifiers=[...]`: Metadata tags for PyPI:\n",
    "    - Indicates compatibility with Python 3.\n",
    "    - Specifies the license as Apache Software License.\n",
    "    - Notes the package is OS-independent.\n",
    "  - `python_requires=\">=3.12\"`: Ensures the package requires Python 3.12 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directory Structure Assumption\n",
    "The `setup.py` assumes the following structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "project_root/\n",
    "├── src/\n",
    "│   └── d2d/\n",
    "│       ├── __init__.py\n",
    "│       └── (other modules, e.g., processor.py)\n",
    "├── README.md\n",
    "├── setup.py\n",
    "└── (optional) MANIFEST.in\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `src` directory contains the package code.\n",
    "- `README.md` provides documentation.\n",
    "- `MANIFEST.in` (if present) lists additional files to include (e.g., data files).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating a `.whl` File\n",
    "\n",
    "A `.whl` (Wheel) file is a binary distribution format for Python packages, offering faster installation than source distributions. Follow these steps to generate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Ensure Python 3.12 or higher is installed.\n",
    "- Install the required build tools:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install setuptools wheel\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Generate `.whl`\n",
    "1. **Navigate to Project Directory**:\n",
    "   - Open a terminal and change to the directory containing `setup.py`:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     cd /path/to/project_root\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "2. **Run the Build Command**:\n",
    "   - Execute the following command to create both a source distribution (`.tar.gz`) and a wheel distribution (`.whl`):\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "3. **Output**:\n",
    "   - The command generates files in the `dist/` directory, e.g.:\n",
    "     - `d2d-0.2.8.tar.gz`: Source distribution.\n",
    "     - `d2d-0.2.8-py3-none-any.whl`: Wheel file, where `py3-none-any` indicates Python 3 compatibility and platform independence.\n",
    "4. **Verify**:\n",
    "   - Check the `dist/` directory for the generated files:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ls dist/\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Ensure all dependencies listed in `install_requires` are correct and available on PyPI.\n",
    "- If additional files (e.g., data, configs) need to be included, create a `MANIFEST.in` file (e.g., `include src/d2d/*.txt` for text files).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing the Package\n",
    "\n",
    "To test or use the package, install it in a clean environment to avoid dependency conflicts. We’ll use `conda` to create a virtual environment and `pip` to install the wheel file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Install\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Clean Environment**:\n",
    "   - Use `conda` to create a new environment with Python 3.12:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda create -n d2d-test python=3.12\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This creates an isolated environment named `d2d-test` with Python 3.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activate the Environment**:\n",
    "   - Activate the environment to work within it:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda activate d2d-test\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Your terminal prompt should now show `(d2d-test)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install the Package**:\n",
    "   - Ensure the `.whl` file (e.g., `d2d-0.2.8-py3-none-any.whl`) is in the `dist/` directory or copy it to your current directory.\n",
    "   - Install the wheel file using `pip`:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pip install dist/d2d-0.2.8-py3-none-any.whl\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This installs the `d2d` package and its dependencies listed in `setup.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "   - Test the package by importing a key component, such as `D2DProcessor`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from d2d import D2DProcessor\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - If no errors occur, the package is installed correctly.\n",
    "   - You can now use `D2DProcessor` or other modules for transforming interview transcripts into structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Ensure the wheel file name matches the version (e.g., `d2d-0.2.8-py3-none-any.whl`).\n",
    "- If issues arise, verify that Python 3.12 is active (`python --version`) and that dependencies are compatible.\n",
    "- To distribute the package, upload the `.whl` and `.tar.gz` files to PyPI using a tool like `twine` (requires additional setup).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This guide covers the structure of the `setup.py` file for the \"d2d\" package, how to generate a `.whl` file using `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`, and how to install it in a clean `conda` environment. Follow these steps to package, distribute, and use the Dialogue2Data tool effectively."
