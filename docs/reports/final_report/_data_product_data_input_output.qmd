### Data Input
The D2D processor processes two types of input files to extract and structure responses from unstructured interview transcripts based on provided guidelines.

\subsubsection*{\large Guidelines}

- A structured file in `.csv` format listing the questions or prompts that the interviewer was supposed to cover to guide the interview and extraction process.
- **Structure**:
  - Single column named `guide_text` with each row containing a question or prompt.
- **Example**:
  - [interview_food_sample_guidelines.csv](https://github.com/avalanche-strategy/D2D/blob/main/data/synthetic_data/interview_food_guidelines.csv)

{{< include _data_product_sample_guidelines.qmd >}}


\subsubsection*{\large Transcripts}

- Raw text files in `.txt` format containing conversational interview data, with labeled segments for interviewers and interviewees.

- **Example**:

{{< include _data_product_sample_transcripts.qmd >}}


### Sample Data Output
Structured output in `.csv` format by matching interviewee responses to guideline questions.

- **Structure**:
  - Columns:
    - `Interview File`: Identifier of the source transcript file (e.g., `001`, `002`).
    - Additional columns named after guideline questions (e.g., "Whatâ€™s a dish that reminds you of your childhood?").
  - Each row corresponds to one interview, with cells containing the extracted response text.
- **Example**:

{{< include _data_product_sample_output.qmd >}}
