## Problem Statement

Organizations often rely on surveys and interviews to understand their users, assess needs, and guide decision-making. 
While traditional question-and-answer surveys provide structured data that is relatively easy to analyze, open-ended formats such as interviews offer deeper, 
more nuanced insights, yet they are difficult to process at scale due to their unstructured and free-flowing nature.

Our capstone partner, Fathom, specializes in analyzing open-ended text data from surveys and interviews. Their platform already supports the analysis 
of structured survey responses, but scaling the analysis of interview transcripts has proven to be a key challenge. The interviews are conducted with 
a predetermined set of guideline questions in mind; however, the interviewer has the flexibility regarding when or whether to ask these questions. 
As a result, interview responses are less uniform and harder to map directly to the original guideline questions. Currently, Fathom’s team relies solely 
on large language models (LLMs) and manual transcript review to extract relevant content. 
This process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale across large volumes of data.

## Data Formats

The dataset used for this project consists of over 200 unstructured, one-on-one conversational interview transcripts, alongside more than 20 sets of guideline questions to which the responses must be mapped. These transcripts come from multiple current partners of Fathom, reflecting a real-world use case.
The output of the pipeline is a structured `.csv` file in which each row corresponds to an interviewee, and each column contains the extracted response to a specific guideline question, enabling seamless downstream analysis and integration into existing workflows. 

## Project Objectives

To address this challenge, we refined the problem into the following tangible data science objectives:

- **Automate the mapping of interview transcript content to original guideline questions**, reducing human effort and improving consistency.
   Fathom currently relies solely on LLMs for response extraction, followed by manual review to ensure quality. This approach is time-consuming and difficult to scale. Automation allows for faster, more consistent analysis and is scalable to handle increasing volumes of interview data without additional manual overhead.

- **Deliver an end-to-end pipeline** that integrates into Fathom’s workflow for repeatable analysis of new interview data.
   For this solution to be impactful, it must fit within Fathom’s analytics infrastructure. An integrated, end-to-end pipeline ensures seamless adoption and allows the team to expand from survey data to conversational interview data with minimal friction.
