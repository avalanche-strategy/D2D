The current release provides practical business value. Like any project, enhanced features and greater flexibility are always a possibility. Below are suggested improvements:

- **Integration Testing**: Our evaluation was restricted to running the evaluator and using our personal judgement on the results. Testing the pipeline end-to-end with varied datasets and expert evaluators would help ascertain how well the model generalizes.
- Visualizing a heatmap of the how Question-Answer Pairs match up to interview guideline questions based on pairwise cosine similarity, reveals a perfectly linear pattern (along the diagonal from top-left to bottom right) for synthetic datasets in @fig-heatmap-food-similarity (_Dialogue questions are plotted on the Y-axis, first question at the top, against guideline questions on the X-axis. A darker shade in the cells represents high cosine similarity between interview and the corresponding guideline question._). The perfect diagonal plot illustrates the difficulty of simulating noisy dialogue. Synthetic dialogues follow the guidelines questions perfectly/robotically. Nonetheless, the heatmap generated from the partner's real-life datasets show that our pipeline is robust enough to find the expected matches (@fig-heatmap-1090-similarity). However, even real-world interviews still exhibit the diagonal pattern albeit less pronounced. We suggesting testing the pipeline with **non-sequential interviews** that do not follow the sequence of guideline questions.
- @fig-heatmap-1090-similarity also shows dialogue sections where some interview questions have very low cosine similarity to all guideline questions. @fig-heatmap-1090-similarity-post zooms into one interview, with such sections highlighted with dotted lines. We propose the addition of **post-processing step**. First, this step would fill in the gaps to any previously un-answered guideline questions. For example, in @fig-heatmap-1090-similarity-post Guideline Question 2 (second column) had "[No relevant response found]" output due to the low cosine similarity scores. However, in the transcript, this question was answered by the dialogue exchange 2 and 3, that are between guideline question 1 (retrieved from row 1) and 3 (retrieved from row 4). After this post-processing, any remaining un-used dialogue portions might be out of topic exchanges (like greetings/pleasantries) or they could be additional useful information that was not covered by the guideline questions. This requirement was a stretch goal for the project. Despite having limited time to implement it, our work has set a basis for this objective to be achieved through the **post-processing step**
