We developed a pipeline that extracts concise summaries from interview transcripts and outputs structured data suitable for integration into our partner's downstream analytical workflows. Alongside this [`processor`](https://github.com/avalanche-strategy/D2D/blob/main/src/d2d/processor.py) pipeline, we built an [`evaluator`](https://github.com/avalanche-strategy/D2D/blob/main/src/d2d/evaluator.py) framework that enables quality assessment of the extracted outputs. Both components are flexible and customizable. They have been tested on a variety of interview formats and topics, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The methods and results presented here offer a strong foundation for future development, while already providing practical value for real-world use.
