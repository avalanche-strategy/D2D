In our capstone project, we designed and developed a functional pipeline that extracts concise summaries from interview transcripts and outputs structured data suitable for integration into our partner's downstream analysis workflows. Alongside this [`processor`](src/d2d/processor.py) pipeline, we built an [`evaluator`](src/d2d/evaluator.py) framework that enables our partner to assess the quality of extracted outputs. Both components are flexible and include hyperparameters that can be adjusted and customized.

The pipeline has been tested across a variety of scenarios and interview topics drawn from the synthetic data set in the public repository and the partner's private dataset (not included in the public repository), demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. We believe the methods and results presented here offer a strong foundation for future development by our partner, while already showing practical value for real-world use.
