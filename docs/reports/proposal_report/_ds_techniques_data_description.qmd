### Use of Data Science Techniques
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) will transform interview transcripts into structured data by extracting entities and sentiments, will then be evaluated using RAGAS and Daedalus for accuracy.

### Data Description
**Interview transcripts** (observational units) are text data guided by questions.

**Example**:

| Speaker     | Text                                                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Interviewer | "Thanks for joining me today.  What’s your name and where are you located?"|
| Participant | "My name’s Camila, outside Jackson, Mississippi."        |
| Interviewer | "Great to meet you, Camila! Who lives with you at home?" |
| Participant | "I live with my husband, dogs, and mom."                 |

### Appropriateness of Data
Transcripts are ideal for RAG/Self-RAG, as LLMs handle natural language for entity extraction.

### Difficulties
- **Filler Words**: Greetings and fillers (e.g., "sure thing") may obscure key content, requiring filtering.  
- **Volume**: Lengthy transcripts demand efficient RAG indexing.
